SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Explains the Rivet configuration file.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    ## Overview
    
    Rivet pulls the many settings it needs from a JSON configuration file called 
    `rivet.json`.  By default, Rivet will look in the current directory for the 
    `rivet.json` file.  The `rivet.ps1` script allows you to pass in the path to your 
    own configuration file.
    
    The `rivet.json` file is written in JSON, because I don't like XML.  Make sure all 
    `\` (i.e. backspace) characters get escaped (e.g. `\\`).  Comments are not allowed.
    
    All non-absolute paths in the `rivet.json` file are resolved as relative to the 
    file itself.  For example, if a setting's path is `Databases`, and the 
    `rivet.json` file is in the `C:\Projects\Rivet\Test` directory, the setting's 
    value will be resolved to `C:\Projects\Rivet\Test\Databases`.
    
    ## Environments
    
    You will most likely have many environments where Rivet will run.  At a minimum, 
    each environment will have a different SQL Server instance.  To support multiple 
    environments, the `rivet.json` file uses a special `Environments` setting, which 
    is a hash of environments, where the key is the environment's name and the value 
    is another hash of settings for that environment. These environment settings 
    override the base/default settings.  If an environment doesn't specify a setting, 
    the base/default setting is used.
    
        {
            SqlServerName: '.\Rivet',
            DatabasesRoot: 'Databases',
            Environments: 
            {
                Production:
                {
                    SqlServerName: 'proddb\Rivet',
                }
            }
        }
    
    In this example, we've defined a `Production` environment which overrides the 
    `SqlServerName` setting.
    
    ## Settings
    
    ### CommandTimeout
    
    The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a command to complete.  The default is 
    30 seconds.
    
    ### ConnectionTimeout
    
    The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a database connection to open.  The 
    default is 15 seconds.

    ### DatabaseOrder

    A list of database names in the order in which Rivet should apply migrations. The 
    default is alphabetical order. If a database is listed here but doesn't exist on the
    file system, it is ignored.
    
    This list doesn't have to list all your databases. Just the ones where order 
    matters. Databases not listed here will continue to have their migrations applied in
    alphabetical order.
        
    ### DatabasesRoot
    
    Rivet assumes a database's migration scripts are stored together.  in 
    `$DatabasesRoot\$DatabaseName\Migrations`.  So, `$DatabasesRoot` should point to 
    the directory which contains the directories for each database.  For example, 
    given this directory structure:
    
        * rivet.json
        + Databases
          + Rivet
            + Migrations
          + RivetTest
            + Migrations
    
    You can see directories for the `Rivet` and `RivetTest` databases under the 
    `Databases` directory.  So, you'll set the `DatabasesRoot` setting to `Databases`.
    
    Rivet assumes there is a one-to-one mapping between the directories under 
    `DatabasesRoot` and a database on the SQL Server.  If this is not the case, and 
    you'd like to exclude/ignore a directory under `DatabasesRoot`, use the 
    `IgnoreDatabases` setting.
    
    ### Environments
    
    A hash of environments, where they key is the environment's name, and the value is 
    another hash of settings for that environment. These environment settings override 
    the base/default settings.  If an environment doesn't specify a setting, the 
    base/default setting is used.
    
    ### IgnoreDatabases
    
    A list of database names to ignore/exclude from the Rivet.  This is useful if you 
    have a directory  under `DatabasesRoot` that doesn't contain a database's 
    scripts.  Wildcards are allowed, e.g. `Shared*` would exclude all directories 
    under `DatabasesRoot` that begin with the word `Shared`.
    
    ### PluginsRoot
    
    This should point to the directory which contains the directory for which plugins 
    should be stored.  For example, given this directory structure:
    
    	* rivet.json
    	+Databases
    	+Plugins
    
    PluginsRoot should point to the "Plugins" directory
    
    ### SqlServerName
    
    The name of the SQL Server to connect to.
    
    ### TargetDatabases
    
    This setting maps database names to lists of target databases. Use this setting if 
    you need to deploy the same migrations to multiple databases, but don't want to 
    duplicate the migration. Should be a hashtable whose key is the name of the 
    database's scripts directory on the file system, and whose value is an array of 
    target database names those scripts should be applied to, e.g.
    
        {
            "TargetDatabases": {
                                    "Database1": [ "Database1", "Database2" ]
                               }
        }
    
    In the above example, scripts in the `Database1` directory will be applied to the 
    `Database1` *and* `Database2` databases.
    
    
    ## Examples
    
    ### Example 1
    
        {
            SqlServerName: '.\\Rivet',
            DatabasesRoot: 'Databases'
        }
    
    This example demonstrates the simplest configuration file. This configuration file 
    will cause Rivet to connect to the `.\Rivet` SQL Server, and load database scripts 
    from the `Databases` directory where the `rivet.json` file is located.
    
    ### Example 2
    
        {
            "SqlServerName": ".\Rivet",
            "DatabasesRoot": "Databases",
            "ConnectionTimeout": 5,
            "CommandTimeout": 300,
            "IgnoreDatabases": [ "Shared" ],
            "DatabaseOrder": [ "Xanadu", "Q" ]
        }
    
    This example demonstrates how to use all the configuration options.  This 
    configuration file will:
    
     * connect to the local `.\Rivet` SQL Server instance
     * load database scripts from the `Databases` directory (which would be in the 
       same directory as the `rivet.json` file)
     * shorten the connection timeout to 5 seconds
     * increase the command timeout to 5 minutes
     * not add the `Shared` database to the list of databases to manage (i.e. it will 
       ignore the `$Databases\Shared` directory)
     * apply migrations to the "Xanadu" and "Q" databases before any others on the file
       file system.
     
    ### Example 3
    
        {
            SqlServerName: '.\Rivet',
            DatabasesRoot: 'Databases',
            Environments: 
            {
                UAT:
                {
                    SqlServerName: 'uatdb\Rivet',
                    IgnoreDatabases: [ 'Preview' ],
                    CommandTimeout: 300
                },
                Production:
                {
                    SqlServerName: 'proddb\Rivet',
                    IgnoreDatabases: [ 'Preview' ],
                    CommandTimeout: 600
                }
            }
        }
    
    This example demonstrates how to create and use environment-specific settings.
